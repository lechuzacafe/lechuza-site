## What's new?

I rebuilt my website using Hugo (again) to make it easier to maintain. To make a long story short, I switched my entire *infrastructure* from a VPS running Debian, to a static AWS S3 website. That also means I no longer provide public services, but fret not! I'll add interesting things to this little website soon.
