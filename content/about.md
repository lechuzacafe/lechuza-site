## About me
Hi, I'm Amanda, and welcome to my blog!

This website is powered by Hugo and running on GitHub Pages. It used to run on an Amazon S3 bucket for some time, though, and before that... a VPS where I'd manually FTP all of the files to the web server it ran. 

Currently, I am learning cloud technologies (mostly Amazon Web Services) and trying to make use of what I know with Linux. I've done Linux server management for other friends, so I'd like to put those skills to good use someday.

You may also look at my GitHub [here](https://github.com/lechuzacafe), if you want to see some projects I worked on.
