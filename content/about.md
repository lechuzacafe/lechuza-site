## About me
Hi, I'm Amanda, and I'm currently a student studying computer science. This website hosts a blog I sometimes write in.

This website is powered by Hugo and running on GitHub Pages. It used to run on an Amazon S3 bucket for some time, though, and before that... a VPS where I'd manually FTP all of the files to the web server it ran. 

Currently, I am learning cloud technologies and trying to make use of what I know with Linux. I've done Linux server management for other friends, so I'd like to put those skills to good use someday.
