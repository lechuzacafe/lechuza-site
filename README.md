# About this site
This is a simple static website running on Hugo. I use a module called GitDoc to automatically commit and push my changes, and a .yaml file for a workflow that automatically builds my Hugo site and updates any changes.
Previously, this website used to run on an Amazon S3 bucket routed through CloudFront, and Amazon DynamoDB with a Python Lambda function working as the visitor counter, but I moved this website over to GitHub Pages to make things a bit easier for me.

# Credits
For my Hugo theme, I used the hugo-bearcub one.
